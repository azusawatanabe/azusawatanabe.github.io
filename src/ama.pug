The main job was to create Marketing Design Campaigns for the entire e-commerce, including banners, web design improvements, newsletters and social media. Also had an important role in the branding re-design that started in sinergy with other departments, resulting in target definition and visual standards. Another important project made was the Photography & Retouch Manual Guidelines, still used as reference for the company. </p>
